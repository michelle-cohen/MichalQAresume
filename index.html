									<h2>My Journey: From Homes and Health to Hunting Bugs</h2>
									<p>Before I became a QA tester with a unique blend of tech, health, and real estate experience, I spent over a decade exploring different paths. I was a real estate agent for five years, a Pilates instructor specializing in mat and reformer, and now I focus on software & web testing. Along the way, Iâ€™ve picked up some pretty cool skills: teaching Pilates taught me to spot the tiniest details (because every exercise needs to be flawless!) and as a real estate agent, I always made sure I knew every detail about the homes I sold so I wouldnâ€™t miss a thing for my clients. Plus, every showing had to be picture-perfect! These experiences shaped me into the detail-oriented, problem-solving, and perfection-loving QA tester I am today.</p>

									<h2>Fun Facts About Me</h2>
									<p>When Iâ€™m not testing software, youâ€™ll probably find me on my motorcycle, cruising to my next adventure. Movement is a big part of my life â€“ Iâ€™m a yoga lover, thrill-seeker, and total sunshine addict! Whether itâ€™s skydiving, water sports, or any activity under the sun, Iâ€™m all in. Whenever Iâ€™m feeling down, I head to the beach to catch the sunset and remind myself that everything is temporary (and that sunsets are free therapy!). Oh, and fearless as I may be, thereâ€™s one thing that gets me every time: cockroaches. Theyâ€™re my kryptonite!</p>

									<h2>Why QA? Because Sudoku Wasnâ€™t Enough!</h2>
									<p>I chose QA because I started feeling like something was missing â€“ I wanted to be part of a team, to use my skills in a way that felt meaningful. As I got older, I realized I wasnâ€™t reaching my full potential in the fields I was in. I craved a dynamic job where I could work with people but also challenge my brain and think creatively. Everything I was doing before had become automatic and repetitive, and letâ€™s be honest â€“ solving Sudoku wasnâ€™t exactly bringing my neurons back to life!

										After taking some online courses in digital marketing and experimenting with projects in the tech world, an ad for QA popped up and caught my eye (thanks, algorithms!). It immediately clicked â€“ I knew this was what Iâ€™d been looking for, the perfect mix of challenge, growth, and creativity. And the rest is history!</p>

							<h2>Skills in Focus: What I Bring to the Table</h2>
							<p>As part of the QA course at "The Automation College," I focused on hands-on practice from the industry, not just theory. I engaged in the entire software development process, including understanding both development aspects â€“ such as website creation (like this site) and learning coding languages. Throughout the process, I worked with industry tools: Testrail, Jira, Agile & Waterfall Methodologies, STD, STR, HTML, and more.
								My skills are more than just technical â€“ I bring curiosity, adaptability, and a passion for delivering exceptional results, no matter the challenge.
